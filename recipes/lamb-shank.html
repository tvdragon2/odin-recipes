  <p>This Lamb Shank recipe is perfect for that special occassion</p>

<p><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>4 lamb shanks</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp dried rosemary</li>
<li>1 large onion sliced</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic crushed</li>
<li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
<li>1/3 cup saba</li>
<li>1/2 tsp chopped rosemary</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
<p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
<li>Place lamb shanks into a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, cinnamon, and rosemary. Toss the lamb shanks to spread oil and seasonings over the meat.</li>
<li>Spread onion slices and garlic cloves into the bottom of a heavy 9x12-inch baking dish. Lay lamb shanks over onions and garlic.</li>
<li>Bake lamb in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
<li>Combine chicken broth and saba in a bowl. Pour mixture over the lamb shanks. Cover baking dish tightly with foil and place baking dish on a baking sheet.</li>
<li>Bake lamb in the oven until a knife pierces the meat easily, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. The meat will be tender but not falling off the bone. Use tongs to turn the shanks over in the pan sauce. Increase temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
<li>Return shanks to oven and bake, uncovered, until meat is fork-tender and the sauce has thickened slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Turn shanks over in the sauce after 10 minutes and check for tenderness; if still not tender enough, return to oven for 10 to 15 more minutes and test again.</li>
<li>Transfer lamb shanks to a bowl and keep warm. Strain pan juices into a saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Skim any excess grease from top of sauce. Taste and season with salt; stir in fresh rosemary. Serve sauce drizzled over lamb shanks.</li>
</ol></p>
